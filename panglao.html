                    Panglao is an island off the coast of Bohol that is similar to Boracay in terms of exquisite white sands and beautiful turquoise waters. The island's diving locations are among the greatest in the Philippines. On the island, there are roughly 250 distinct crustacean species and 2,500 various mollusk species, several of which are recently identified.
                    <br> <br> Panglao Island, in fact, seems to have more marine species and biodiversity than Japan and the Mediterranean Sea altogether, as per the Panglao Marine Biodiversity Project studied. Panglao Island is currently being expanded, and the government seeks to establish an airport to augment tourism on the island.
                    <br> <br> Alona Beach, Panglao Island’s very well-known shoreline, might well be hectic and expensive, yet it provides great diving. Also renowned are the beaches of Dumaluan and Doljo.

                <p class="card-text">Our Lady of the Assumption Church, which incorporates Byzantine and Romanesque influences, is worth seeing if you love architecture. It exhibits some magnificent murals as well as a little well said to contain magical healing water. Even though it was partially damaged in the 2013 earthquake, it is still worth viewing.

                <p class="card-text">Hinagdanan Cave has an underground lagoon to explore. In Carmen, go over to the renowned chocolate hills. Touring the island on a motorcycle is a great way to do so. Cruise along the verdant waterways of the Loboc River on a floating dining boat while also being serenaded by Filipino musicians and enjoying delectable seafood.
